Let's assume that the application is being developed with Python. I am not widely
familiar with the language, though I had a basic programming course with it many
years ago.

On the website of Visual Code Studio, the editor I use, I found 3 tools for linting
that Microsoft recommends:

- Pylint
- flake8
- mypy

It also seems that frameworks like Unittest and Pytest are quite common for testing
applications, while setuptools and poetry for building them.

Apart from GitHub Actions and Jenkins, people also use GitLab often, though some other
platforms are also rather popular, like Travis CI.

I guess a self-hosted setup is going to cost much more than cloud solutions, since in
this case you need to setup and maintain the servers yourself. The benifits though are
great, like full control and protection of data transfers and improved transfer speed.

Cloud-solutions are more budjet friendly and therefore suitable for newbees and middle-
sized organizations. Moreover, the team doesn't have to be experts in server maintanance.
